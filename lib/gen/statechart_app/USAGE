statechart_app - Create a new SproutCore application target using statecharts.

USAGE:

  sc-gen statechart_app AppName [--filename=FILENAME] [--target=TARGET_NAME]

DISCUSSION:

This generator will create a new SproutCore application with statecharts by
default for a particular project.  You should pass as the first parameter your
AppName you want to create.  For example:

  sc-gen statechart_app Todos

This defines a new application called Todos in the file apps/todos/ using
statecharts.  Within the apps/Todos/resources directory you will have a
statechart.js file and a states directory with the ready_state.js file.  The
statechart.js file sets the initial state of your app to ready.

As your app grows.  You will create new states within the statechart.js file.
In your states folder you will describe the states declared in the statechart.js.
