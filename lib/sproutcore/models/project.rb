module SC

  # A project describes a collection of targets that you can build.  Normally
  # you instantiate a project by calling Project.load() method.  You should
  # pass in the path of the project and the project type.  The project type
  # will determine the namespace used in the buildfile to detect and load
  # tasks.
  #
  # == Examples
  #
  # Load a SproutCore-style project:
  #
  #  Project.load('myproject', :sproutcore)
  #
  # Load a standard gcc-build project:
  #
  #  Project.load('myproject', :cc)
  #
  # == How a Project is Loaded
  #
  # When you load a project, here is what happens:
  #
  # 1. Locate and load Buildfiles, if any are found
  # 2. Run project_type:target:find for all targets defined for the project.
  #    this will locate and define the targets for the project
  # 3. If you request a build of a particular resource, a manifest will be
  #    built for the target.  This manifest contains a series of rules that
  #    can be invoked in order to build the named resource.
  #
  class Project

    # the path of this project
    attr_reader :project_root

    # Parent project this project shoud inherit build rules and targets from
    attr_reader :parent_project
    
    # Proc that will be called when changes are detected to a monitored project
    attr_accessor :monitor_proc
    
    # regex so that certain files don't trigger monitor update
    attr_accessor :nomonitor_pattern

    # When a new project is created, you may optionally pass either a
    # :parent option or a :paths options.  If you pass the paths option, then
    # this class will search the paths for projects and initialize them as
    # parent projects to this one.
    #
    # If you pass a parent project, then this project will start out with a
    # clone of the parent project's buildfile and targets.

    # clone any targets from a parent project, and then calls
    # find_targets_for() on itself to recursively discover any targets in
    # the project.

    # If you need to change the way the project discovers project, override
    # find_targets_for() instead of this method.
