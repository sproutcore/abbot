    # A Rack application for serving dynamically-built SproutCore projects.
    # Most of the time you will use this application as part of the sc-server
    # command to dynamically build your SproutCore project while you develop
    # it.
    #
    # If you are deploying some Ruby-based infrastructure in your production
    # environment, you could also use this application to dynamically build
    # new versions of your SproutCore apps when you deploy them.  This would
    # allow you to potentially bypass the pre-deployment build step using
    # sc-build.
    #
    # While this model is supported by the Rack adaptor, it is generally
    # recommended that you instead build you app without using this adaptor
    # since the build step will help catch possible errors in your code before
    # you go live with your project.  Sometimes, however, dynamically building
    # content is useful, and that is what this adaptor is for.
    #
    # === Using This Application
    #
    # When you instantiate a builder, you must provide one or more projects
    # that contain the resources you want to load.  Each incoming request url
    # will be mapped to an entriy in a project manifest.  The entry is then
    # built and the resulting file returned.  Once a file has been built, it
    # will not be rebuilt unless the source file it represents has changed.
    #
    # In addition to dynamically building entries, the Builder can also
    # forwards requests onto an SC::Rack::Proxy app to handle proxies
    # requests.
    #
    # === Config Settings
    #
    # This app respects several options that you can name in your config file
    # (in addition to proxy configs), that can affect the app performance.
    # Normally reasonable defaults for these settings are built into the
    # SproutCore buildfile, but you may choose to override them if you are
    # deploying into a production environment.
    #
    #  :reload_project::  If set to true, then the builder will reload the
    #    projects to look for changed files before servicing incoming
    #    requests.  You will generally want this option while working in
    #    debug mode, but you may want to disable it for production, since it
    #    can slow down performance.
    #
    #  :use_cached_headers:: If set to true, then the builder will return
    #    static assets with an "Expires: <10-years>" header attached.  This
    #    will yield excellent performance in production systems but it may
    #    interfere with loading the most recent copies of files when in
    #    development mode.
    #
    #  :combine_javascript:: If set, the generated html will reference a
    #    combined version of the javascript for elgible targets.  This will
    #    yield better performance in production, but slows down load time in
    #    development mode.
    #
    #  :combine_stylesheets:: Ditto to combine_javascript
    #
    class Builder

      # used to set expires header.
