*SproutCore 1.8.0 (March 06, 2012)*

* Bumped the gem version to 1.8.0
* Bumped SC to REL-1.8.0
* Merge pull request #84 from pulletsforever/dwk/manifest.appcache
* Merge pull request #74 from dkduck/redirect-fix
* Figuring out how to use the language generator properly was hard to decipher, so I made the first argument the target app and the second argument the language.  If no target app is given, it falls back to the default behaviour, which requires a target.
* Fixed documentation of app and statechart_app generators.
* Removed the statechart_project generator.  It was identical to the project generator.
* Bumped version to 1.8.0 and bumped SC framework to latest.
* Add --statechart switch support when using sc-gen app or sc-gen project (not that it has an effect with sc-gen project, but someday it may).
* Removed templates for html_app.
* Removed deprecated options and removed --template which doesn't create a skeleton useful for a 1.8 project.
* Fixed --dry-run option to work for sc-init and sc-gen.
* Updated app.manifest to be manifest.appcache per http://html5.org/r/5812
* Merge pull request #81 from sproutcore/team/workmanw/windows-spriting-fix
* Bumped SC version.
* The :mini framework (which was empty) has been removed from SproutCore for 1.8.
* Added check before writing chance stuff to a file. If it's writing a png file it will be written as binary. This fixes spriting on Windows, previously newlines were converted to CRLF on Windows.
* Merge pull request #79 from sproutcore/team/workmanw/sc-init-template-buildfile-fix
* Updated abbot's Buildfile templates to reflect the changes made to sproutcore/master regarding moving the template system out of 'core_foundation' and into it's own framework 'template_view'.
* This only returned the lines that matched and removed those that didn't.
* Merge public branch
* Merge pull request #76 from ChadEubanks/master
* fixed a typo in description.
* updated init.rb to call a statechart_project upon creation of an app using the --statechart switch and included a description of the inital files created in the statechart_project INIT file.
* fixed indentation of the statechart.js file.
* moved statechart.js to root of app directory, set up the statechart with just an initial ready state, and revised the property readyState to have proper casing.
* updated statecharts switch to be --statechart and revised the generated code for statechart_app.
* Modified abbot to have a state switch on sc-init.  This builds a new sproutcore project with statecharts by default.
* Modified abbot to have a state switch on sc-init.  This builds a new sproutcore project with statecharts by default.
* updated sc-init to include statecharts out of the box.
* Merging public branch
* Bumping js library submodule
* Preprocess JSON files for static_urrl
* Instead of overriding "readlines" everywhere, add a new "read" method and use that instead...
* fixes a bug with automatically following redirects to external hosts
* Typo.  The proper setting is : connect_timeout
* em-http changed the single :timeout setting to separate :inactivity_timeout and :connection_timeout settings, so this exposes these timeouts to the proxy config.  Note, this still works with current Buildfiles since proxy[:timeout] is mapped over to :inactivity_timeout of em-http.
* More complete fix for #69, thanks rykov!
* Ruby 1.8 only allows splats for the last argument - Fixes #69
* Updated StaticHelper to include the image_urls_for_client function
* Typo prevented skipping of `top-right`

*SproutCore 1.7.1.beta (August 30, 2011)*

MINOR FEATURES

* When the file hits the 4096 CSS selectors limit in IE , the tools will split the files.
* Sprites are now optimized to use space in the most optimal way, to reduce
memory foot print generated by a lot of extra transparent space.
* Layout.js will be always first when building the js files , just as strings.js (Layout.js includes loc metrics)
* Added security feature for dev environment. By default sc-server can only be used from your local machine unless you set a flag.

BUG FIXES

* Sprites is again the default for abbot after several perf problems with base64 urls across different browsers.
* Minification is optimized again to minify the index.html.
* Fixes for whitelist, when the name filenames include the 'html' string.
* Several bug fixes for speed and reliability of whitelisting.
* Fixed retina display styling.
* Fixed --help command line option.
* Updated abbot gem dependencies.

* Adding touch_enabled flag to avoid having the touch icons included (default is still true)

* Fix to chance to avoid a Windows error
* Change jQuery.ready() to SC.ready() in HTML template, which allows SC.RootResponder to attach event listeners before the app runs.
* Changed the generators so they create more descriptive names. Before, we had lots of files with the same name, which was confusing in editors and in the webkit inspector. This solves that problem.
* Adding timestamp to sc-build logger, thanks Tony Sung

*SproutCore 1.5.0.pre.4 (February 28, 2011)*

* We are beginning to move API that we don't believe will be ready before 1.5
release into the `experimental` framework. If your apps rely on code that is
migrated to experimental, please make sure you include it as a dependency. For
more, please see frameworks/experimental/README.md.
* Support for extending classes after they've been created with the
reopen()/enhance() combo. For more, see: [this
discussion](http://groups.google.com/group/sproutcore-dev/browse_thread/thread/d65ad54d6fddef5d)
	* This change may break existing code if you call sc_super() in your mixins.
	If your app throws exceptions after updating, please see [this post](http://groups.google.com/group/sproutcore-dev/browse_thread/thread/cc6a97e6133cb8cc).
* Added SC.TemplateView and Handlebars. These allow you to specify the content
of your views using templates.
	* {{#view}} helper allows you to define child views
	* {{#bind}} helper allows you to render a property, and automatically update DOM if that
	property ever changes.
	* {{#collection}} helpers allows you to render a simple collection of items
	using templates
	* SC.TextFieldSupport and SC.CheckboxSupport mixins for SC.TemplateViews
	that wrap <input> elements.
* Split SC.View into units of functionality. SC.View remains functionally the
same, but you can now use SC.CoreView, a light-weight subset of SC.View.
* SC.ImageView will use a <canvas> tag on platforms that support it, which
improves performance significantly.
* SC.SegmentedView now creates an overflow menu if there are too many segments
to display.
	* Class names for SC.SegmentedView have been cleaned up. You may need to
	update your CSS if you were theming SC.SegmentedView.
* You can now observe the contents of enumerables using the special `@each`
key.
* Dependent keys can accept property paths. For example, you can say
.property('foo.bar'), and it will be invalidated if the `bar` property of
`foo` changes.
* Deprecated SC.viewportOffset(). Please use SC.offset() instead, which is
more explicit about what it returns.
* SC.browser now detects Android devices.
* SC.device.orientation now works reliably on desktop, iOS, and Android 2.1
and above.
* Experimental support for gyroscope information, if provided by the browser.
* Unit tests for runtime, desktop, foundation, core_foundation, and datastore
are all passing.
